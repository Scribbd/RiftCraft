#RiftCraft

Current status: In Development. RAW, and very unstable!

**Usage IS Completely And Totally On YOUR OWN RISK**

For the sake of your sanity, if you decide to fork out. Don't use the DevBranch, this is only for personal use and sync commits which are `git reset --soft HEAD^` every time I decide to work on the mod.
When you work in this branch and decide to sync up to my latest work, expect things to break.

All branches coming out of the DevBranch (current example: DevEvents) are for merging or cherry picking. Depends on how out of sync the master is to the branch.
